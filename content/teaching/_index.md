   I aim to serve as a bridge to connect various disciplines through developing statistical methods and models and spread the concepts of statistics to the public. I would love to focus on developing students’ interests on statistical thinking and making advanced statistical methods and models reachable for students from other disciplines or students without solid mathematics background.

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside talk/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
