   I aim to serve as a bridge to connect various disciplines through developing statistical methods and models and spread the concepts of statistics to the public. I would love to focus on developing students’ interests on statistical thinking and making advanced statistical methods and models reachable for students from other disciplines or students without solid mathematics background.
   
    I taught undergraduate-level course Regression Analysis(STA210) during summer 2022. I also TAed for advanced topics Bayesian statistics(STA602), Network Analysis(STA650), and Causal Inference(STA640). I would love to encourage students to think in statistical way, transmit what they have learned to real-world practice, interpret and communicate of these statistical models and methods. 
    
    Currently I applied pedagogic methods to encourage cognitive learning, collaborative learning and cooperative learning. And I would love to try some question-driven pedagogic methods to encourage actively learning.

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside talk/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
