As a teaching assistant, I hold 75-min lab weekly. I designed all the lab materials and knitted it using bookdown package: [Introduction to Network Analysis using R](https://yunranchen.github.io/intro-net-r/). 

## Outline

- Basic introduction on network objects. R packages including `igraph`, `statnet` (including `sna`, `network`).
- Collect network data.
  -   Web API requesting (Twitter, Reddit, IMDB, or more).  
  -   Useful websites (SNAP, or more)
  -   Visualization (static and dynamic networks).
- Network analysis using package `amen`.
