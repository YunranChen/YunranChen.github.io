This is a data competition within a day and a half. I collaborate with other four members (from Department of Finance and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering) to explore how Indeed can better serve its existing customers and possibly expand the boundary of data applications in the real market.

We give some suggestions to job seekers using the mismatch between demand and supply in different cities. (Dynamic Visualization by Junhong Chen and Xu Lu). We aim to provide some advice for Indeed to improve the number of clicks of posted jobs for different companies. (Bayesian Hierarchical Model by Yunran Chen and Rui Wang) Finally, we try to find out how critical data given by Indeed can be incorporated into existing models to predict macro-level indices. (Fama-French Three Factor Model by Hang Su).
