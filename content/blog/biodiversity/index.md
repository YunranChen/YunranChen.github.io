Biodiversity is a measure of the variablity and variety of all forms of life in ecosystems. Data is presented in OTU tables and taxonomy tables. Description and comparison of biodiversity is hard due to: (1) high-dimensional, sparse and correlated OTU counts (2) biodiversity should be measured from multiple aspects including richness and evenness (3) differences in sequencing depth and sampling effort may cause bias in measuring biodiversity. 

We apply Krona Wheel to visualize biodiversity and characterize biodiversty using divrsity profiles based on Hill numbers, prevalence numbers.
