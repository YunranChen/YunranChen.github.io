For classifications and regressions with predictors on known manifolds, an extrinsic method is to embed manifolds into Euclidean spaces by introducing extrinsic kernel in Gaussian Process. Here I review on "Extrinsic Gaussian Processes for Regression and Classification on Manifolds" by Lin et al.(2019).
