We are interested in describing DNA damage and repair process when exposed to chemicals over time. An experiment is conducted for different cells under distinct dose levels and repair time. Our main goal is to explore how different chemical exposures relate to DNA damages over time. We consider a multi-level generalized linear model to explore relation between DNA damage and dose level, replication, repair time.
