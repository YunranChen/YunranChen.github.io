Since I began building websites in Y2K, I've lost count how many times the phrase "...there's got to be a better way to do this" has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid `TABLE`.

Well, technology sure has come a long way since slicing up images to match the table-based layout that was just created in Dreamweaver. You'd be surprised (or maybe you wouldn't) how challenging the standard header, content, sidebar, footer layout could be to actually get right.
