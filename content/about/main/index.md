intro: I am currently a Ph.D. candidate under supervision of [Dr. Surya Tokdar](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~st118/) in Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. I obtain Bachelor's degree in Remin University of China in Beijing and Master's degree at Duke University. I am interested in Bayesian factor model, nonparametric Bayes, and applications in neuroscience. My goal is to serve as a bridge to connect various disciplines through developing statistical methods and models, and spread the concepts of statistics to the general public.
