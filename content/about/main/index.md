intro: I am currently a Ph.D. candidate under supervision of [Dr. Surya Tokdar](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~st118/) in Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. I obtain Bachelor's degree in Remin University of China in Beijing and Master's degree at Duke University. I am interested in Bayesian factor model, nonparametric Bayes, and applications in neuroscience. My goal is to serve as a bridge to connect various disciplines through developing statistical methods and models, and spread the concepts of statistics to the general public. I am currently enrolled in Certificate in College Teaching ([CCT](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching)) program and Preparing Future Faculty ([PFF](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/preparing-future-faculty)) program.
